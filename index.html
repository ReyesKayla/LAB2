		<h3> Introduction </h3>
		<p class="indented""style"> Kinetic theory states that all molecules in matter are in constant motion (Kane and Sternheim, 1984). As these molecules absorb more energy
						they have a higher amount of  random movement. <br> As energy is absorbed in the form of heat the average kinetic energy(temperature) of the molecules
						will increase except during a phase change. The absorbed energy used in the phase change <br> breaks the attractive forces between the molecules, thus 
						transformation occurs in the orientation of the molecules. An example of a phase change would be the boiling  point of water which is a <br> change from a
						liquid to a gas. This can beobserved by using a temperature versus time line graph when the slope becomes zero (plateau) The boiling point of water
						is expected to be 100.00 oC (Merck, 1976). </p>
		<h3> Objective </h3>
		<p class="indented"> The purpose of this experiment is to determine the boiling point of water. </p>
		<h3> Hypothesis </h3>
		<p class="indented"> If the pressure in the classroom is close to 1 atmosphere, then the boiling point of water should be approximately 100 degrees Celsius. </p>
		<h3> Materials List </h3>
		<div class="indented">
			<ul>
				<li> 500 ml beaker </li>
				<li> distilled water </li>
				<li> thermometer </li>
				<li> hot plate </li>
				<li> Word Processing Software </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3> Procedure </h3>
		<div class="indented">
			<ol>
				<li> The required materials were selected and taken to the workstation. </li>
				<li> The beaker was filled with approximately 300 ml of distilled water. </li>
				<li> The beaker was gently placed on the hotplate. </li>
				<li> The thermometer was placed in the beaker and the initial temperature was recorded. </li>
				<li> The hotplate was switched on to high. </li>
			</ol>

		<div class="indented"> <u> Qualitative Results </u> </div>
		<p class="indented"> Numerous small bubbles formed at the bottom of the beaker at 70.6 oC. The size and rate of bubble formation increased as the temperature increased.
		At 100.0 oC the rate and size of <br> bubble formation remained constant. At that temperature, there was constant production of steam. </p>
		<h3> Calculations/ Analysis </h3>
			<p>
			<center> <img src="3.png" width="350" height="250" alt="3"> </center> </p>
		<h3> Conclusion </h3>
		<p class="indented">
			It was determined from the data plotted in the temperature versus time graph (Figure 2) that the boiling point of water is 99.51 o C. 
			This concurs very closely with the stated hypothesis, <br> therefore the experiment was deemed a success. The percent error was found 
			to be 0.49%. Possible sources of error could have involved impurities in the water and human error in reading <br> the thermometer. 
			Possible sources of error may be impurities in the water which may be chemicals from dirty glassware. Improvements would include 
			more accurate thermometers, clean <br> equipmentand proper reading of the thermometer. </p>
